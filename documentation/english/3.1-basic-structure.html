        Clients are the most basic thing in phpAdsNew and all campaigns and banners 
        are always owned by a certain client. The first thing you will have to 
        do when you want to add a banner for a new client is to create a new client 
        inside phpAdsNew. For each client you can setup contact information and 
        a username and password, which can be used to view the statistics of the 
        campaigns and banners owned by the client. </p>

        Clients can have multiple advertising campaigns at the same time, each 
        with different objectives and properties. A campaign can contain multiple 
        banners and is always owned by a certain client. If you create a new campaign 
        you can set an starting date on which the campaign must become active 
        and you can also determine on which date the campaign must be deactivated. 
        If you don't specify an end date, phpAdsNew will assume you want to display 
        the banners of this campaign indefinitely, or at least until further notice. 
        In addition these specific dates, you can also let phpAdsNew deactivate 
        the campaign when a certain number of banners where displayed, or after 
        a certain number of AdClicks. For example, if you have set the campaign 
        to deactivate after 30 days or 40000 AdViews, it will deactivate after 
        one of these conditions is met, whichever comes first.<br>
        The campaign weight affects the probability of how much a banner is displayed. 
        If you set higher campaign weight, the banner of this campaign will be 
        shown more often than banner of a campaign with a lower weight.<br>

        A banners is always part of an advertising campaign, which in its turn 
        is always owned by a client. So, if you want to add a banner, you must 
        add it to an existing campaign or create a new campaign for it..<br>
        There are currently four different types of banners. Database stored banners 
        and Webserver stored banners are very similar and only differ in the way 
        they are stored. Linked banners are used to add banners which are stored 
        on an external server, for example the webserver owned by the client. 
        HTML banners can be used to add banner which consist of purely HTML code, 
        such as an interactive form, or other types of rich-media banners.</p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Destination URL</span><br>
        The address of the website or page where you want to browser to go to, 
        when a user clicks on the banner. You always need to specify the full 
        url, including the prefix http://</p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Alt-text</span><br>
        The text you specify in this field will be shown when the actual banner 
        image is still loading. </p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Status text</span><br>
        If you want to display a text in the status area of the browser (usually 
        in the bottom of the window), you need to enter the text in this field</p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Dimensions</span><br>
        This field will be automatically filled with right value if you use Database 
        stored or webserver stored banners. Otherwise you need to manually set 
        the width and height of the banner. This information is used, when you 
        want to link a banner to a zone, or when you want to display a banner 
        on you website with a specific width, height or both.</p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Keywords</span><br>
        It is possible to assign one or more keywords to every banner, which can 
        be used when you want to display specific banners on your website. If 
        you want to assign more than one keyword to a banner you must separate 
        the different keywords with a space.</p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Weight</span><br>
        You can influence the probability of how much a banner is displayed. If 
        you increase the banner weight, the banner will be shown more often than 
        a banner with a lower weight.<br>
        The probability of how much a banner is displayed is not only affected 
        by the banner weight, but also by the campaign weight. If you want to 
        know more about how both weight affect the probability, please read chapter 
        x.x Banner weights<br>

        A zones is basically a group of different banners. It doesn't matter to 
        what campaign the banners belong, or by which client the banners are owned. 
        You can link banners from different campaigns and clients to the same 
        zone, as long as all banner in that zone have the same dimensions. After 
        you have created a zone, it is very simple to link it to banners. All 
        available banners, which match the dimensions of the zone, will be listed 
        with a checkbox next to it. Just check the ones you want to link and click 
        on 'Save changes'.</p>
      <p><span class="subtitle">Why would you need to group banners?</span><br>
        Very simple a zone can be used as a selection of banners to be displayed 
        on a certain location of you website. For example: you can create a zone 
        for all the banners you want to show on the homepage of your websites, 
        additionally you can create another zone for all the banners you want 
        to show on the top of all the other page, etc..<br>
        Zones are designed to allow you to easily change what banners are displayed 
        on certain locations of your website. If you want to change the banners 
        you want to display on the frontpage, simply change the banners linked 
        to the zone which is displayed on the frontpage. </p>
