        If you are trying to install phpAdsNew, the installer will first check 
        if your server meets the conditions which are required for phpAdsNew to 
        function correctly. If you server configuration is not compatible with 
        phpAdsNew you will get one of the following warnings: </p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">phpAdsNew requires PHP 3.0.8 or higher to function 
        correctly</span><br>
        The version of PHP which is installed on you webserver is not compatible 
        with phpAdsNew. To solve this problem you need to upgrade to PHP 3.0.8 
        or higher. If you need to upgrade we recommend that you upgrade to the 
        latest release of PHP 4. PHP 3 is currently still supported, but this 
        may be dropped in future versions of phpAdsNew.</p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">The PHP configuration variable register_globals 
        needs to be turned on</span><br>
        In order to function correctly phpAdsNew needs depends on the register_globals 
        function of PHP. If you want to continue the installation of phpAdsNew 
        you first need to make sure this setting is turned on in your PHP configuration 
        file. For more information about this setting, please check the PHP manual.</p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">The PHP configuration variable magic_quote_gpc 
        needs to be turned on</span><br>
        In order to function correctly phpAdsNew needs depends on the magic_quote_gpc 
        function of PHP. If you want to continue the installation of phpAdsNew 
        you first need to make sure this setting is turned on in your PHP configuration 
        file. For more information about this setting, please check the PHP manual.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">The PHP configuration variable magic_quotes_runtime 
        needs to be turned off</span><br>
        In order to function correctly the magic_quotes_runtime function of PHP 
        needs to be turned off. If you want to continue the installation of phpAdsNew 
        you first need to make sure this setting is turned off in your PHP configuration 
        file. For more information about this setting, please check the PHP manual.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">phpAdsNew has detected that your config.inc.php 
        file is not writeable by the server</span><br>
        Before you can start installing phpAdsNew it will check wether the config.inc.php 
        is writable by the webserver. If the file isn't writable phpAdsNew can't 
        store the configuration. You can change the file permissions on a Unix/Linux 
        server using the chmod command or by using your ftp client. If you need 
        more information on how to unlock the config.inc.php file, please read 
        chapter 2.1.1 or 2.2.1</p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">Could not connect to database, please recheck the 
        settings you specified</span><br>
        This warning could mean two different things, first of all it is possible 
        the installer could not determine if the hostname of the database server 
        you specific exists and couldn't connect to it. This could be because 
        you made a typo, or because the server currently isn't available. Please 
        check the settings you entered and if these are correct, please make sure 
        the database is up and running. It is also possible the username or password 
        you specified isn't correct. </p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">The user you specified doesn't have permission 
        to create or update the database structure</span><br>
        The user you specifed is a valid mysql user and phpAdsNew was able to 
        connect to the database with the user you specied, but when trying to 
        create a table MySQL reported the user wasn't allowed to. Before you continue 
        you need to make sure the user has enough priviledges to alter existing 
        tables and create new tables. If you are not sure on how to do this, please 
        contact the administrator of the database server.</p>
      <p><br>
        <span class="subtitle">Table prefix contains invalid characters</span><br>
        Table names can only contain certain characters. The table prefix is used 
        to create the name of the tables which need to be created and you used 
        a character which isn't allowed. Make sure you use only the following 
        characters: a - z and _.</p>

        </span>This is a known bug in IE 4 and higher. phpAdsNew 1.9 and higher 
        do have a workaround for this bug, but it only works in remote invocation 
        with JavaScript and local mode. Normal remote invocation is still affected 
        by this bug. Microsoft is aware of this bug for some time and IE 6 apparently 
        works fine. If you use normal remote invocation there is nothing we can 
        do about it.</p>

        Your PHP is not configured for MySQL support. If you're on Unix, you need 
        to recompile PHP --with-mysql. If you're on Windows, you have to enable 
        the MySQL DLL in your PHP configuration. See the manual, installation 
        section, for more details.</p>
