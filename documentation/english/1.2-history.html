        In 1998 Tobias Ratschiller created phpMyAdmin, a tool to administer MySQL 
        databases, written in PHP. After the launch of phpwizard.net, the home 
        of the phpMyAdmin project, more projects were added, like phpIRC, phpChat, 
        phpPolls and phpAds.</p>
      <p>PhpAds started out as a free tool, which let developers place banners 
        on their website. The code was released under the GPL licence and a whole 
        community of users grew around this wonderful piece of software. After 
        about a year and four releases the project was abandoned because Tobias 
        didn't have the time to continue working on it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile phpAds had really become a popular solution. People were asking 
        for new features and started fixing the still existing bugs. Because the 
        development on phpAds wasn't controlled by anyone anymore Wim Godden decided 
        it was time to breath life again in the old phpAds project. PhpAdsNew 
        was born, a new project, based on the old phpAds source code.</p>
      <p>Wim started working on improving the old source code, adding new features 
        and fixing the remaining issues. PhpAds 1.4 grew into phpAdsNew 1.5 and 
        kept evolving into phpAdsNew 1.8. Because the time involved to maintain 
        a project like phpAdsNew Wim asked for developers to help him improve 
        phpAdsNew. A number of other developers like Phil Hord and Niels Leenheer 
        joined the project and added their own new features. After the release 
        of phpAdsNew 1.9 the developers really felt the project lacked a number 
        of features which prevented the project becoming a mature ad server.</p>
      <p>Niels took it upon him to lead the development of phpAdsNew 2. The goals 
        for phpAdsNew 2 were very high and a lot of work was spend on rewriting 
        the code to make it more stable and implementing the features that were 
        really essential for any serious ad server. With the help of a lot of 
        developers all kinds of new features were added and a completely new user 
        interface was developed. There are just too many changes in phpAdsNew 
        to completely list them here. Halfway during the development of phpAdsNew 
        2 Matteo Beccati created a PostgreSQL port of phpAdsNew and joined the 
        project to help us. Later on Stefan Morgenroth joined the project and 
        contributed his own continuation of the phpAds project, called phpAdsPlus. 
        A number of features found in phpAdsPlus, such as Flash support, were 
        still missing in phpAdsNew and they were quickly adapted for phpAdsNew.</p>
      <p>After 8 months and 6 beta versions it was decided to work towards the 
        final release of phpAdsNew 2. This doesn't mean the development of phpAdsNew 
        is coming to an end. Beta 7 will be the last 2.0 beta, but we are already 
        planning new additions and great new features. </p>
      <p>What can you expect from us in the future?<br>
        With the release of phpAdsNew 2 we think we have the basic requirements 
        for a mature ad server, and this is the main thing we are focussing on 
        right now. After this very important milestone we can build on these basic 
        features and create an even better solution. It is too early to give a 
        complete feature list for the next major release of phpAdsNew but there 
        are some things we want to work on in the future. Traditionally phpAdsNew 
        is written to be deployed on only one website. This doesn't mean the current 
        release isn't able to server ads for multiple websites, but it isn't optimised 
        for this purpose. This is one of the things we want to change in the next 
        major release. In addition to this we want to introduce more advanced 
        features like user sessions which allow use to target users individually 
        and much much more.<br>
        Stay tuned!</p>
      <p>Also a final note: Wim, Phil, Niels, Matteo and Stefan are not the only 
        developers who worked on this piece of software. PhpAdsNew wouldn't the 
        same without all the code contributed by a large number of other developers. 
        Thanks to everyone who helped make this project possible, you know who 
        you are. Also many thanks to Tobias Ratschiller who started all of this, 
        without his early work on phpAds this project would probably not exist.<br>

        PhpAdsNew is a free and open-source project dedicated to developing a 
        mature ad serving solution for low and medium sized websites. PhpAdsNew 
        evolved out of the phpAds project created by Tobias Ratschiller and is 
        currently developed by a group of independent PHP programmers. Because 
        of its capabilities and expandability phpAdsNew is increasingly used on 
        high profile websites to help them generate the revenue needed to keep 
        their websites running. More information about phpAdsNew can be found 
        on www.phpadsnew.com</p>
