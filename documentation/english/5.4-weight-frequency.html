      <p>PhpAdsNew has some very advanced features to which allow you to be very 
        flexible when you add a campaigns to your inventory. If you create a new 
        campaign or when you edit the properties of an existing campaign you can 
        determine the priority of the campaign. The priority of the campaign determines 
        how often a banner belonging to that campaign is selected and displayed. 
        There are two types of campaigns: high priority and low priority.<br>
        <br>
        Every hour phpAdsNew will decide how likely it is a campaign will be shown 
        during invocation. This probability factor will be calculation based on 
        the settings of each campaign and real-time statistics and predictions 
        based on old statistics. </p>

        If you choose to set your campaign to high priority, you can assign a 
        target for the number of impressions the campaign will have each day. 
        Everyday phpAdsNew will try to display the banners in your campaign exactly 
        as many times as you specified as the target. For example if you set the 
        target for a high priority campaign to 40000, phpAdsNew will try to display 
        the banners in that campaign 40000 times each day.</p>
      <p>However this is not an exact science and this feature depends a lot on 
        predictions based on already existing statistics. Every hour phpAdsNew 
        will try to predict the total number of impressions it will get during 
        the day and how they are spread over the different hours. If a campaign 
        is falling behind on the predictions phpAdsNew will increase the probability 
        factor of the campaign in relation to the campaigns which are on schedule.<br>
        The prediction and compensation routines should be able to compensate 
        for all kinds of external factors, including display limitation and should 
        be able to spread the impressions of high priority campaigns evenly of 
        the course of the day.</p>
      <p>The actual result will depend a lot on how consistant the existing statistics 
        are, therefor it is not recommended to use high priority campaigns with 
        only a few days of statistics available. If you do decide to use high 
        priority campaigns without a couple of days of statistics the prediction 
        and compensation routines will try to meet the targets you have set, but 
        it might not have enough data to spread the impressions evenly of the 
        course of the day.</p>
      <p>Also keep in mind, phpAdsNew only adjusts the probability of each campaign 
        every hour and a lot can happen in one hour. If for example your website 
        is visited a lot more than predicted phpAdsNew is not able to compensate 
        for that until the next hour.</p>

        If the high priority campaigns do not use all the predicted impressions 
        to meet their targets, low priority campaigns will be displayed to fill 
        the remaining impressions. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to give one low priority campaign more impressions 
        than another low priority campaign, by adjusting the weight of the low 
        priority campaign. A low priority campaign with a weight of 2 will be 
        displayed twice as much as a low priority campaign with a weight of 1. 
        However the total number of impressions of a low priority campaign can 
        not be set, only the ratio of impressions between two low priority campaigns. 
        The actual number of impressions also depends on the number of impressions 
        and the total target of all high priority campaigns. For example: if you 
        usually have 10000 impressions each day and the high priority campaigns 
        use 6000 impressions to meet their set targets, only 4000 impressions 
        will be used to display low priority campaigns.</p>

        Up till now we have only talked about how the predicted number of impressions 
        are spread over the different campaigns and how you can adjust the probability 
        of how much a campaign is displayed in relationship with another campaign, 
        but it is also possible to adjust how the number of impressions are spread 
        among the banners inside a campaign.</p>
      <p>In contrast with older versions of phpAdsNew the banner weight will only 
        affect the probability of how much a banner is displayed in relationship 
        with other banners in the same campaign. The campaign weight or target 
        will determine how the impressions relate to other campaigns. If you have 
        a banner with a weight of 3 it will be displayed three times as much as 
        a banner with a weight of 1, but only within the same campaign. Another 
        banner inside another campaign with weight 1 may be displayed more often 
        than your banner with weight 3, because the campaign itself might be displayed 
        more often.<br>
