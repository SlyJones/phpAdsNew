  a long time, but since version 1.9 phpAdsNew now supports compact statistics 
  and the compact stats are even used by default. Compact statistics are faster 
  than verbose stats and take a lot less storage space on the MySQL server. There 
  is a drawback however, the compact stats are less accurate than the old verbose 
  stats, there are no hourly overviews for example.</p><p><br><span class="subtitle">How can I speed up phpAdsNew?</span><br>You can speed up phpAdsNew considerably by reducing the functionality. You 
  could disable multiple keywords and conditional keywords. You could enable 'delayed 
  inserts' as well, which should increase the speed of statistics logging. Other 
  things that influence the speed of phpAdsNew are reverse lookup, sequential 
  banner retrieval and banners stored in MySQL. If you really need to serve massive 
  amounts of banners you could try using multiple servers. It is possible to store 
  banners on an external ftp/webserver, use a different server for the MySQL database 
  and serve the ads from a different server as your webserver. It is even possible 
  to use multiple servers which all have phpAdsNew and MySQL installed and use 
  same database which is replicated over all the servers.</p><p><br><span class="subtitle">My MySQL server uses too many resources, what can I do?</span><br>You can reduce the load on the MySQL server by storing banners on the webserver 
  instead of the MySQL server. It is also possible use 'delayed inserts' which 
  can be turned on in the configuration file. If phpAdsNew uses persistent connections 
  to the MySQL server you could try turning this off in the configuration file. 
  Persistent connections do speed up phpAdsNew, but increase the load on the MySQL 
  server. <br></p><p><br><span class="subtitle">Can you help me to install phpAdsNew? Can you please implement this feature 
  I need?</span><br>Maybe. Let us know what you want...</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td class="plain">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td width="100" height="75"><a name="2"></a></td><td width="600" height="75">&nbsp;</td><td height="75">&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
