<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>Does phpAdsNew has support cache busters?</h4>
<p>In some circumstances you may want to add a banner network to phpAdsNew. Some 
  banner networks rely on cache busters in order to work correctly. A cache buster 
  is a random string of digits which must be unique in every call to the banner 
  network. In the next example the # must be replaced with unique number everytime 
  the banner is shown. <br>
  http://servedby.advertising.com/site=12345/size=468060/bnum=########/bins=1/rich=0<br>
  <br>
  If you add this banner network to phpAdsNew you must use 'Banner refered through 
  URL' and replace the random number with the following string {random:x} and 
  replace x with the number of digits you want to have. For example:<br>
  http://servedby.advertising.com/site=12345/size=468060/bnum={random:8}/bins=1/rich=0</p>
<p>If you need to add the same random number to both the image and the target 
  url you can simply specify the same {random:x} code in both the image and target 
  url. phpAdsNew will make sure the string {random:x} is replaced with the same 
  number in both cases.</p>
<h4>What's the difference between compact statistics and verbose statistics?</h4>
<p>Verbose statistics were the only kind of statistics phpAdsNew supported for 
  a long time, but since version 1.9 phpAdsNew now supports compact statistics 
  and the compact stats are even used by default. Compact statistics are faster 
  than verbose stats and take a lot less storage space on the MySQL server. There 
  is a drawback however, the compact stats are less accurate than the old verbose 
  stats, there are no hourly overviews for example.</p>
<h4>How can I speed up phpAdsNew?</h4>
<p>You can speed up phpAdsNew considerably by reducing the functionality. You 
  could disable multiple keywords and conditional keywords. You could enable 'delayed 
  inserts' as well, which should increase the speed of statistics logging. Other 
  things that influence the speed of phpAdsNew are reverse lookup, sequential 
  banner retrieval and banners stored in MySQL. If you really need to serve massive 
  amounts of banners you could try using multiple servers. It is possible to store 
  banners on an external ftp/webserver, use a different server for the MySQL database 
  and serve the ads from a different server as your webserver. It is even possible 
  to use multiple servers which all have phpAdsNew and MySQL installed and use 
  same database which is replicated over all the servers.</p>
<h4>My MySQL server uses too many resources, what can I do?</h4>
<p>You can reduce the load on the MySQL server by storing banners on the webserver 
  instead of the MySQL server. It is also possible use 'delayed inserts' which 
  can be turned on in the configuration file. If phpAdsNew uses persistent connections 
  to the MySQL server you could try turning this off in the configuration file. 
  Persistent connections do speed up phpAdsNew, but increase the load on the MySQL 
  server. <br>

<h4>Can you help me to install phpAdsNew? Can you please implement this feature 
  I need?</h4>
<p>Maybe. Let us know what you want...</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<h4>phpAdsNew doesn't display any banners on pages which are the result of a form 
  being submitted in IE</h4>
<p>This is a known bug in IE 4 and higher. phpAdsNew 1.9 does have a workaround 
  for this bug, but it only works in remote invocation with JavaScript and local 
  mode. Normal remote invocation is still affected by this bug. Microsoft is aware 
  of this bug for some time and IE 6 apparently works fine. If you use normal 
  remote invocation there is nothing we can do about it.<br>
</p>
<h4>phpAdsNew doesn't display any HTML banners</h4>
<p>HTML banners are only supported if you use remote invocation with JavaScript 
  of local mode. It is not possible to display HTML banner with normal remote 
  invocation. </p>
<h4>The login doesn't work, it keeps prompting for username/password all over 
  again or I can't add banners</h4>
<p>Make sure you have enabled magic_quotes_gpc in your PHP configuration.<br>
  Make sure $phpAds_url_prefix in config.inc.php is exactly the same as it is 
  on the server (http://www.test.com/phpads is not the same as http://www.test.com/phpAds). 
  Also make sure it doesn't end with a slash (/).</p>

<h4>I get the following error: Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function 
  mysql_(p)connect()</h4>
<p>Your PHP is not configured for MySQL support. If you're on Unix, you need to 
  recompile PHP --with-mysql. If you're on Windows, you have to enable the MySQL 
  DLL in your PHP configuration. See the manual, installation section, for more 
  details.</p>
