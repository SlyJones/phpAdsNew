</p>
<hr><h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Please read first the INSTALL file for installation instructions.<br>
  If you are upgrading from a previous version of phpAdsNew you should read the 
  UPGRADE file for instructions.</p>
<p>In the current release, you have to configure all your information in config.inc.php.</p>
<h3>Database configuration</h3>
<p>Before you can use phpAdsNew you need to tell phpAdsNew which database to use 
  and which username and password to use.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_hostname</h4>
<p>Specify the hostname of the MySQL database server.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_mysqluser</h4>
<p>Specify the username which phpAdsNew must use to gain access to the MySQL database 
  server.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_mysqlpassword</h4>
<p>Specify the password which phpAdsNew must use to gain access to the MySQL database 
  server.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_tbl_adclicks<br>
  $phpAds_tbl_adviews<br>
  $phpAds_tbl_adstats<br>
  $phpAds_tbl_banners<br>
  $phpAds_tbl_clients<br>
  $phpAds_tbl_session<br>
  $phpAds_tbl_acls</h4>
<p>If you wish to use different table names, for example to match the existing 
  table names of you project, you can specify the alternative names here. Be aware, 
  the tables you name here must be created; phpAdsNew will not automatically create 
  these tables.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_persistent_connections</h4>
<p>If you want to use persistent connections to the database server you must specify 
  &quot;1&quot;, otherwise specify &quot;0&quot;. The use of persistent connection 
  can speed up phpAdsNew considerably, but requires a lot of resources. If phpAdsNew 
  is using too many resources, you should take a look at this setting first. Persistent 
  connections are turned off by default.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_insert_delayed</h4>
<p>MySQL lock the table when it is inserting a row. If have many visitors to your 
  site, it could be possible phpAdsNew must wait before inserting a new row, because 
  the database is still locked. When you use insert delayed, you don't have to 
  wait and the row will be inserted at a later time when the table is not in use 
  by any other thread. Another major benefit of using insert delayed is that inserts 
  from many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much 
  faster than doing many separate inserts, but could cause data corruption when 
  the database server should crash. This option is turned off by default.<br>
</p>
<h3>phpAdsNew configuration</h3>
<p>phpAdsNew needs to know a few things about the system you are using in order 
  to function correctly, for example the location of phpAdsNew.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_url_prefix </h4>
<p>phpAdsNew needs to know where it is located on the web server in order to work 
  correctly. You must specify the URL to the directory where phpAdsNew is installed, 
  for example: http://www.your-url.com/phpAdsNew</p>
<h4>$phpAds_my_header<br>
  $phpAds_my_footer</h4>
<p>You should put here the relative path (e.g.: /home/login/www/header.htm) to 
  have a header and/or footer on each page in the admin interface. You can put 
  either text or html in these files (if you want to use html in one or both of 
  these files do not use tags like &lt;body&gt; or &lt;html&gt;)</p>
<h4>$phpAds_table_border_color<br>
  $phpAds_table_back_color<br>
  $phpAds_table_back_color_alternative<br>
  $phpAds_main_back_color</h4>
<p>If you want you can change the look of phpAdsNew by changing these colors. 
  The default color scheme is blue.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_language</h4>
<p>Specify the default language phpAdsNew should use. This language will be used 
  as a default for the admin and client interface. Please note: you can set a 
  different language for each client from the admin interface and allow clients 
  to change their language themselves.</p>
<p>phpAdsNew currently supports these languages:<br>
  czech, dutch, english, flemish, french, german, hungarian, italian, polish, 
  russian-cp1251, russian-koi8r and spanish.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_name</h4>
<p>Specify the name you want to use for this application. This string will be 
  displayed on all pages in the admin and client interface.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_company_name</h4>
<p>This name is used in the e-mail sent by phpAdsNew.</p>
<h3>Statistics and logging</h3>
<h4>$phpAds_compact_stats</h4>
<p>Traditionally phpAdsNew used rather extensive logging, which was very detailed 
  but was also very demanding on the database server. This could be a big problem 
  on sites with a lot of visitors. Since version 1.9 phpAdsNew uses a new kind 
  of statistics, the compact statistics, which is less demanding on the database 
  server, but also less detailed. The compact statistics only logs daily statistics, 
  if you need hourly statistics you can turn the compact statistics off.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_log_adviews</h4>
<p>Normally all AdViews are logged, if you don't want to gather statistics about 
  AdViews you can turn this off.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_log_adclicks</h4>
<p>Normally all AdClicks are logged, if you don't want to gather statistics about 
  AdClicks you can turn this off.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_reverse_lookup</h4>
<p>phpAdsNew logs the ip address of each visitor by default. If you want phpAdsNew 
  to log domain names you should turn this on. Reverse lookup does take some time; 
  it will slow everything down.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_ignore_hosts</h4>
<p>If you don't want to count clicks and views from certain computer you can add 
  these to this array. If you have enabled reverse lookup you can add both domain 
  names and ip addresses, otherwise you can only use ip addresses.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_begin_of_week</h4>
<p>For most people a week starts on a Monday, but if you want to start each week 
  on a Sunday you can.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_percentage_decimals</h4>
<p>Specifies how many decimal places to display on statistics pages.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_warn_admin</h4>
<p>phpAdsNew can sent you e-mail if a client has only a limited number of clicks 
  or views left. This is turned on by default.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_warn_client</h4>
<p>phpAdsNew can sent the client e-mail if he has only a limited number of clicks 
  or views left. This is turned on by default.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_warn_limit</h4>
<p>The limit on which phpAdsNew starts sending warning e-mails. This is 100 by 
  default.</p>
<h3>Banner retrieval</h3>
<h4>$phpAds_random_retrieve</h4>
<p>phpAdsNew can use four different types of banner retrieval: Random banner retrieval 
  (0, default), Normal sequential banner retrieval (1), Weight based sequential 
  banner retrieval (2) and Full sequential banner retrieval (3).</p>
<p>For example, you have set 4 banners in phpAdsNew and the second banner is weight 
  2 (rest of the banners is weight 1):</p>
<p>Random banner retrieval: 1312312331231231231232312314121312<br>
  Normal sequential banner retrieval: 1234 3214 4213 2314 3241<br>
  Weight based sequential banner retrieval: 12324 43122 31221 21342 42321<br>
  Full sequential banner retrieval: 1234 1234 1234 1234 1234 </p>
<h4>$phpAds_con_key</h4>
<p>phpAdsNew includes a powerful banner retrieval system. For more information, 
  please read the API section. With this option, you can activate conditional 
  keywords. This is turned on by default.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_mult_key</h4>
<p>For each banner, you can specify one or more keywords. This option is needed 
  if you want to specify more than one keyword. This is turned on by default.</p>
<h4>$phpads_default_banner_url<br>
  $phpads_default_banner_target </h4>
<p>If phpAdsNew can't connect to the database server, or can't find any matching 
  banners at all, for example when the database crashed or was deleted, it won't 
  display anything. Some users may want to specify a default banner, which will 
  be displayed in these situations. The default banner specified here will not 
  be logged and won't be used if there are still active banners left in the database. 
  Be aware this default banner should only be used as a failsafe, not as a regular 
  banner. This is turned off by default.</p>
<h3>Banner storage and types</h3>
<h4>$phpAds_type_sql_allow<br>
  $phpAds_type_web_allow<br>
  $phpAds_type_url_allow<br>
  $phpAds_type_html_allow</h4>
<p>phpAdsNew can use different types of banners and store them in different ways. 
  The first two options are used for local storage of banners. You can use the 
  admin interface to upload a banner and phpAdsNew will store the banner in the 
  SQL database (option 1) or on a webserver (option 2). You can also use a banner 
  stored on a different webserver (option 3) or use html to generate a banner 
  (option 4). You can disable any one of these types by altering these settings. 
  By default all bannertypes are turned on.</p>
<p>If you disable a certain banner type while there are still banners available 
  of the this type, phpAdsNew will allow the use of these banners, but will not 
  allow the creation of new banners of this type.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_type_web_mode</h4>
<p>If you want to use banners stored on the webserver, you need to configure this 
  setting. If you want to store the banners in a local directory set this option 
  to 0. If you want to store the banner on an external FTP server set this option 
  to 1. On certain webservers you may want to use the FTP option even on the local 
  webserver. </p>
<h4>$phpAds_type_web_dir</h4>
<p>Specify the directory where phpAdsNew needs to copy the uploaded banners to. 
  This directory needs to be writable for PHP, this could mean you need to modify 
  the UNIX permissions for this directory (chmod). The directory you specify here 
  needs to be in the webserver' document root, the webserver must be able to serve 
  the files directly. Do not specify a trailing slash (/). You only need to configure 
  this option if you have set $phpAds_type_web_mode to 0. </p>
<h4>$phpAds_type_web_ftp</h4>
<p>Specify the FTP server where phpAdsNew needs to copy the uploaded banners to. 
  The directory you specify here needs to be in the webserver' document root, 
  the webserver must be able to serve the files directly. The URL you specify 
  here can include an username, a password, the server name and the path. </p>
<pre>ftp://phpads:1234@ftp.phpads.com/www/ads</pre>
<p>phpAdsNew will try to log in using username &quot;phpads&quot;, password &quot;1234&quot; 
  on the ftp server called &quot;ftp.phpads.com&quot; and will try to upload the 
  banners in the directory &quot;www/ads&quot;. If you don't specify a directory 
  phpAdsNew will upload the banner to the root directory of the FTP server. If 
  you don't specify a username and password phpAdsNew will try to login as an 
  anonymous user with the administrators e-mail address. It is not recommended 
  to store you banners on an FTP server which can be accessed by anonymous users!!! 
  Do not specify a trailing slash (/). You only need to configure this option 
  if you have set $phpAds_type_web_mode to 1. </p>
<h4>$phpAds_type_web_url</h4>
<p>If you store banners on a webserver, phpAdsNew needs to know which public URL 
  corresponds with the directory you specifed above. Do not specify a trailing 
  slash(/). You need to configure this option if you have set $phpAds_type_web_mode 
  to 0 or 1.</p>
<h3>Administrator configuration</h3>
<h4>$phpAds_admin</h4>
<p>The administrator username, you can specify the username that you can use to 
  log into the administrator interface.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_admin_pw</h4>
<p>The administrator password, you can specify the password that you can use to 
  log into the administrator interface.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_admin_fullname</h4>
<p>Specify the administrator's full name. This used when sending statistics via 
  email.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_admin_email</h4>
<p>The administrator's e-mail address. This is used as from-address when sending 
  statistics via email.</p>
<h4>$phpAds_admin_email_headers</h4>
<p>You can alter the e-mail headers used by the e-mails which phpAdsNew sends.</p>
