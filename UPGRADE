phpAdsNew 1.6.x or 1.7.x -> phpAdsNew 1.8

config.inc.php has a few new parameters you should set.


-----------------------


phpAdsNew 1.4.x or 1.5.x -> phpAdsNew 1.6

phpAdsNew 1.6 has a slightly modified acl table. You are advised to either reinstall your tables or make these changes
manually :
alter table acls change acl_type acl_type enum('clientip','useragent','weekday','domain','source','time') not null default 'clientip';




-----------------------


phpAds - 1.4.0 -> phpAdsNew 1.5

phpAdsNew is not 100% compatible with phpAds. You are advised to upgrade to phpAds 1.4.0 before attempting to upgrade to
phpAdsNew 1.5.
The view() call is not compatible with phpAds. It now has a different 4th parameter. Anyone using the withtext or context
parameters should add an empty parameter in between.
New fields have been added in the current tables. You are advised to make these changes :
mysql> alter table banners add column weight tinyint(4) default '1' NOT NULL;
mysql> alter table banners add column seq tinyint(4) default '0' NOT NULL;
mysql> alter table banners add column target varchar(8) default '' NOT NULL;
The best way to upgrade the php files is to completely erase your previous phpAds directory (as always, keep a backup until
the new version works fine) and untar the current release. You will notice files have changed extensions from php3 to php, so
make sure your webserver understands the php-extension as either php3 or php4 files. Don't forget to edit your new
config.inc.php because there are quite some changes !



-------------------------------------------------------------------

phpAds - 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0

Version 1.4.0 is not 100% compatible to version 1.3.0.

The syntax of the view() call in local mode is downwards compatible. 
With remote invocation, a new argument ("n") was introduced to allow
multiple remote banners. The syntax with remote invocation remains 
downwards compatible to 1.3.0, though.

New tables and new fields in existing tables have been introduced. It
is recommended to reinstall the tables completely, and to add your
banners from scratch. 

If you want to preserve your old banners, you may be able to do the
necessary changes manually:
The table clients has one new field, which you'll need to add manually:
   expire date DEFAULT '0000-00-00'
The table acls is new. Please don't go this path on a production 
environment without further testing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Attention:
Updates, Upgrades, and changes should never be performed in a 
production environment without careful testing on a staging server.
