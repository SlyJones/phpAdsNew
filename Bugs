WinCvs is somehow experimental and is provided without support
or great documentation.

- patch.exe from the regular cvs distribution will fail to patch very often :
it has no impact since cvs will send the entire file instead : I've not identified
the problem but patch.exe 2.5 seems to work better so I added it to the WinCvs
distribution.
- when using -z9, it was freezing. I did fix it temporaly (see zlib.c).
- Not all the options are avalaible thru the menus, so use the command line
instead.
- Still a problem for the multi-files picking : I think I do
the good thing and the browser still cut the line after xxx files.
- I still don't know if ssh works.
- cvs release has some problems due to the fact that cvs is recalling itself.
Set the HOME variable to the same location than WinCvs and it may work.
